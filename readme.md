# NachtVanCuijk

This website is meant as sign up and information place for the event that happens every half a year
at [Koning Willem 1 College Cuijk](https://kw1c.nl/). Anybody is able to access the source code and use it to what they
want and request pull requests. Any feedback will be thought about and discussed.

## Contributing to the website

There is a [Trello](https://trello.com/) page. On this page are cards of things need to be done and other information
over future features of the website. If you do want to contribue you can join the Trello board and move these cards to
start working on a project. After that you fork the project. Add the feature and execute a pull request to add the
feature to the website. This feature will then be intergrated into the website if executed properly.
